## How to Run the Application
When you download this file, click `index.html` to run this application. You will see Cameron's portfolio page. You will use the web develop tools to inspect it. Don't forget to check 4 links listed on this page as well:

4. Cam's Pizzeria

## Tactics for Optimize Website Performance
### Improve index.html
If you want to make HTML faster, there are two major tactics:
parse less, parse later. So what you can do are:

1. Minimize images: change the size, use `jpeg`, use the compress ones which are provided by PageSpeed.
2. Use the media query to print.css
3. Use `async` or `defer` to javascript.
### Improve pizza.html
When you open the develop tool's console,
you can see the `on load time`,`average script time`,and `resize time`. Improve these three jankies in `main.js`.

1. `line 530` code generate the background pizzas when the file loaded. However the amount is far for used.
Reduce the pizza's amount in the loop function.
2. `line 502` code will change the horizon positions when you scroll. The style calculation in the for loop will
cause the layout thrashing. So batch the calculation outside the loop using `array` and `array.map` method.
3. `line 451` code can resize the pizza images listed in menu part. It has the same solution pattern as `line 502`. And you can use `fastdom` library to solve it as well.
```Javascript
fastdom.measure(()=>{
    //same code as previous
    fastdom.mutate(()=>{
        //reflow code, like element.style.width = ...
    })
})
```
## Website Performance Optimization portfolio project

Your challenge, if you wish to accept it (and we sure hope you will), is to optimize this online portfolio for speed! In particular, optimize the critical rendering path and make this page render as quickly as possible by applying the techniques you've picked up in the [Critical Rendering Path course](https://www.udacity.com/course/ud884).

To get started, check out the repository and inspect the code.

### Getting started

#### Part 1: Optimize PageSpeed Insights score for index.html

Some useful tips to help you get started:

1. Check out the repository
1. To inspect the site on your phone, you can run a local server

  ```bash
  $> cd /path/to/your-project-folder
  $> python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8080
  ```

1. Open a browser and visit localhost:8080
1. Download and install [ngrok](https://ngrok.com/) to the top-level of your project directory to make your local server accessible remotely.

  ``` bash
  $> cd /path/to/your-project-folder
  $> ./ngrok http 8080
  ```

1. Copy the public URL ngrok gives you and try running it through PageSpeed Insights! Optional: [More on integrating ngrok, Grunt and PageSpeed.](http://www.jamescryer.com/2014/06/12/grunt-pagespeed-and-ngrok-locally-testing/)

Profile, optimize, measure... and then lather, rinse, and repeat. Good luck!

#### Part 2: Optimize Frames per Second in pizza.html

To optimize views/pizza.html, you will need to modify views/js/main.js until your frames per second rate is 60 fps or higher. You will find instructive comments in main.js. 

You might find the FPS Counter/HUD Display useful in Chrome developer tools described here: [Chrome Dev Tools tips-and-tricks](https://developer.chrome.com/devtools/docs/tips-and-tricks).

### Customization with Bootstrap
The portfolio was built on Twitter's <a href="http://getbootstrap.com/">Bootstrap</a> framework. All custom styles are in `dist/css/portfolio.css` in the portfolio repo.
